<h3>s-Block:</h3> Groups 1 and 2, including hydrogen and helium. These elements fill their outermost electron shell with s-orbital electrons.<br>

<h3>p-Block:</h3> Groups 13 to 18. Elements in this block fill their outermost electron shell with p-orbital electrons.<br>

<h3>d-Block:</h3> Transition metals, found in groups 3 to 12. These elements fill their outermost electron shell with both s- and d-orbital electrons.<br>
